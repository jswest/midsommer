# Midsommer

A bare-bones implmentation of the self-organizing map algorithmâ€”and a way to visualize it.

## How to use it.

If you're working in just a JavaScript environment, this should work just fine.

```javascript
import { SOM } from "midsommer";

const config = {
	// see config options below.
}

const som = new SOM(config);
som.train(data);
```

For an example of its usage in a Svelte context, pleas see `/src/routes/+page.svelte`.

## The example.

Run `npm run dev -- --open` to see the example application, which shows a self-organizing map of senators in the 117th congress. The vectors are descriptions of their votes.

The data for the example is drawn from [Voteview](https://voteview.com) data for the Senate during the 117th Congress.
